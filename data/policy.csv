Schools in a region can reopen if that region is in Phase IV of reopening and if its daily infection rate remains below 5 percent or lower using a 14-day average since unPAUSE was lifted. Schools will close if the regional infection rate rises above 9 percent, using a 7-day average, after August 1. New York State will make the formula determination during the week of August 1 to 7.""    As of July 13th, New York City is in Phase 3. Other regions are in Phase 4.      ""New York State, the Reimagine Education Advisory Council and the Department of Health released finalized guidance and guiding principles for reopening schools today... The DOH and Governor's Reimagine Council are working closely with the Department of Education as it releases education guidance. Plans to reopen schools are due on July 31.""      OxCGRT's coding policy is to retain the code going into the summer holidays until schools officially start reopen, even if the State's guidance has relaxed. Hence, the code will remain 3G.
